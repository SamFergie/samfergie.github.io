									<h1>A professionally made game for
									laid back fun.</h1>
									<p>I used the RLNet and RogueSharp frameworks along with C# .NET to <br />create an experience to rival the classic PC game Rogue.</p>

								<p>I made this project for my Computer Science A-Level coursework, for which I achieved 97% and an A*. I made use of agile methodologies and often set short, daily goals which helped keep me on task. By using C#.NET I made use of advanced programming frameworks such as LINQ statements when searching data structures. I made comprehensive use of object oriented programming which helped organise code and streamline the debugging process.</p>

								<h2>What did I learn</h2>
								<p>During this project I learnt a lot about the trials of modern software development. Specifically, how the rigors of documentation can clash with the desire to keep working. I would often find myself coding hours into the night only to wake the next day with little understanding of what I'd done due to the lack of comments. By the end of the project I made sure all the code I made was thoroughly commented from the start.</p>
								<h2>What help did I get</h2>
								<p>It's impossible to work alone in the software industry, and this project was a prime example of that. I was working with unfamiliar libraries and solving problems I hadn't ever encountered. So I found guidance. The libraries I used came with a <a href="https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/">good tutorial from which I based the project. </a>This provided a start but I found the tutorial to be restricted in terms of freedom to explore and add additional features. <br />To that end, I worked with my A-Level Computer Science teacher, Mr A Liu, to conceptualise a procedural map generation algorithm. This was the main challenge in making the project and consumed a plurality of the time. The end result was brilliant, a map generation algorithm that utilised graph theory algorithms to provide a greater layer of challenge to the player by restricting game progression before a key is obtained on the current level.</p>
